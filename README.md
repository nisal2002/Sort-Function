# Selection Sort in Python

This Python script demonstrates the selection sort algorithm to arrange a list of numbers in ascending order. The selection sort algorithm repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and appends it to a new list, effectively sorting the elements.

## How the Selection Sort Works

1. An unsorted list, `old_list`, is provided with a set of numbers.
2. An empty list, `new_list`, is created to store the sorted elements.
3. The script iterates over the `old_list` until it's empty.
4. In each iteration, it finds the minimum element in the `old_list`.
5. The minimum element is removed from the `old_list` and appended to the `new_list`.
6. The process continues until all elements are sorted, and the `new_list` contains the sorted elements in ascending order.

## Usage

To sort a list of numbers using the selection sort algorithm, you can provide your list in the `old_list` variable and run the Python script.

## Features

- Efficient sorting algorithm for small to medium-sized lists.
- Sorts elements in ascending order.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `selection_sort.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where `selection_sort.py` is located.
5. Run the sorting algorithm by executing the command: `python selection_sort.py`.

Witness the selection sort algorithm in action as it arranges your list in ascending order!
